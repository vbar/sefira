sefira is a C++ library, so you need a C++ compiler to build it (it's
developed with gcc 4.3 on Linux). It's built using autotools
(automake, autoconf and libtool), and because the repository doesn't
contain the files that autotools generate, you need them installed
before starting the build. You also need libxml2, used for parsing the
XML input. The first part of the build is generating the makefiles:

autoheader
aclocal
libtoolize
automake --add-missing
autoconf

Once created, the generated files should stay OK even when you edit
sefira source code (autotools set the makefiles to remake themselves
when their source Makefile.am changes). Afterwards, the build is the
same as for any GNU distribution:

./configure
make

Various configure parameters allow customization of compilation flags,
installation directories etc. - run ``./configure --help'' for an
overview. make makes sefira executables (technically their wrappers,
but that doesn't make any difference for a simple execution) available
in the bin directory, so that they can be tested by running

make check

(requires expect). Test trees for the automated check (in testdata
directory) are quite small - if you want bigger inputs, you can
generate some with the gentree.py script available in scripts
directory (requires python). For debugging or use of libsefira (if you
can think of any), it can be installed by running (as root)

make install
